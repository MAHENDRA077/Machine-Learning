# Perceptron: A Detailed Explanation

Perceptron is one of the simplest types of **artificial neural networks (ANNs)** and serves as the foundation for deep learning models. It is a **binary classifier** that makes decisions based on a **linear decision boundary**.

## 1. Understanding the Perceptron Model
A **Perceptron** takes multiple **input features** and combines them using a weighted sum. It then applies an **activation function** to determine the output.

Mathematically, the perceptron is represented as:

```math
Y = f(W \cdot X + b)
```

where:
- `X` = input feature vector.
- `W` = weight vector.
- `b` = bias.
- `f(⋅)` = activation function.
- `Y` = output (either 0 or 1).

### Components of a Perceptron
1. **Inputs**: A vector of real numbers representing features.
2. **Weights**: Each input has an associated weight that determines its importance.
3. **Bias**: A constant that helps shift the activation function.
4. **Summation Function**: Computes the weighted sum of inputs:

   ```math
   Z = W \cdot X + b
   ```

5. **Activation Function**: Determines the output class based on `Z`.

## 2. Activation Function in Perceptron
The perceptron traditionally uses a **step function** (also called a **Heaviside function**) to classify inputs:

```math
f(Z) = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if } Z \geq 0 \\ 0, & \text{if } Z < 0 \end{cases}
```

This means:
- If the weighted sum is **positive or zero**, the perceptron outputs **1**.
- If the weighted sum is **negative**, the perceptron outputs **0**.

### Why Use an Activation Function?
- The step function allows perceptrons to **classify data**.
- Modern neural networks use **sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax** instead for better gradient-based optimization.

## 3. Learning Process: Perceptron Training Algorithm
The **Perceptron Learning Algorithm** helps the model learn optimal weights based on training data.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize Weights & Bias** (Random or Zero).
2. **For each training example (`X_i, y_i`)**:
   - Compute the predicted output:
     ```math
     \hat{Y} = f(W \cdot X + b)
     ```
   - Compute the update:
     ```math
     \Delta W = \eta (y - \hat{Y}) X
     ```
     ```math
     \Delta b = \eta (y - \hat{Y})
     ```
   - Update weights:
     ```math
     W = W + \Delta W
     ```
     ```math
     b = b + \Delta b
     ```
3. **Repeat** for multiple epochs until convergence.

**Where:**
- `η` = Learning rate (controls step size).
- `y` = True label.
- `Ŷ` = Predicted output.

## 4. Perceptron Strengths & Limitations
### Advantages:
✅ **Simple & Efficient** – Works well for linearly separable problems.  
✅ **Fast Convergence** – Updates weights iteratively.  
✅ **Interpretability** – Weights indicate feature importance.
✅ It works **only for linearly separable data**.

### Limitations:
❌ **Cannot Solve XOR Problem** – Only works for **linearly separable** data.  
❌ **Single-layer Perceptron is Limited** – Cannot model complex patterns.  
❌ **Step Function is Non-differentiable** – Prevents gradient-based learning.  

💡 **Solution**: Use **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** with non-linear activations like **sigmoid, ReLU**.
